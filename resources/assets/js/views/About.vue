                    Let's start from the beggining..<br>
                    Currentlly I'm a full time Office Manager at Consulteer doo in Zrenjanin by day, and by night I try to learn as much as I can about web development.
                    My engagement in Consulteer is only temporary but it was enough to make me realize what my real love is and why I have decided to study computer programing in the first place.<br>
                    My passion is creativity... I love the feeling when you finish something that makes you up all night and to present it to your friends, coleagues, family... to feel the joy and be proud of yourself to learn something new and resolve every problem along the way.<br>
                    Albert Einstein used to say that once we stop learning, we start dying. And so I developed a taste for learning new things, because I want to stay forever young :) <br>

                     As you can see, I am a full time animal lover, Bookaholic, occasional binge-watcher. Enjoying art of others and trying to make something of my own. Not shy to make mistakes and ask questions. I really don't like to be the smartest one in the room :) but always there to share the knowledge. <br>
                     I'm not afraid to dream big and to work hard. Hope someday to find a group of people equaly enthusiastic as me to work with and learn from.
