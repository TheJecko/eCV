                    <h4>Hi! I'm Jelena.</h4>
                    And this is my online CV wrapt up in yet another project.<br>
                    Here you can check out all the little work I have done so far as a learning proces. Note that I'm not a web designer but only a design&amp;tech lover, so I don't have an "eye of an Designer" and this is just a short an overview of technologies I want to learn and use. <br>
                    Since you are here, I've probably already sent you my Resume and you know everything about my age, education, experience etc.  <br>
                    I donâ€™t have any real experience in Software development but I surely have the knowledge and a Bachelor degree in computer science, also a strong desire of learning new technologies and having the possibility of constant promotion and personal development.
                    In next few minutes (or pages) I will try to convince you to pick up your phone and call me for that job interview. <br>
                    <h5> Enjoy! </h5>
